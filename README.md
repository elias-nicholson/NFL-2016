# NFL-2016
This app offers a new way to view the statistics at the team level for the 2016 season of the NFL.
Several features include an interactive map and plot, as well as a data table.

Run this app from R or RStudio with the following command:
```
if (!require(shiny))
  install.packages("shiny")
runGitHub("elias-nicholson/NFL-2016")
```
Alternately, but preferably not due to time contraints, the app can be viewed from the URL via shinyApps.io:
efn3.shinyapps.io/nfl_2016/

Note:
This was meant as a personal project and the data gathered was from the web via the National Football League
